abstract = {We study the problem of learning to accurately rank a set of objects by combining a given collection of ranking or preference functions. This problem of combining preferences arises in several applications, such as that of combining the results of different search engines, or the "collaborative-filtering" problem of ranking movies for a user based on the movie rankings provided by other users. In this work, we begin by presenting a formal framework for this general problem. We then describe and analyze an efficient algorithm called RankBoost for combining preferences based on the boosting approach to machine learning. We give theoretical results describing the algorithm's behavior both on the training data, and on new test data not seen during training. We also describe an efficient implementation of the algorithm for a particular restricted but common case. We next discuss two experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost. In the first experiment, we used the algorithm to combine different web search strategies, each of which is a query expansion for a given domain. The second experiment is a collaborative-filtering task for making movie recommendations.},

The models embed text from 16 languages into a shared semantic space using a multi-task trained dual-encoder that learns tied cross-lingual representations via translation bridge tasks (Chidambaram et al., 2018). The models achieve a new state-of-the-art in performance on monolingual and cross-lingual semantic retrieval (SR). Competitive performance is obtained on the related tasks of translation pair bitext retrieval (BR) and retrieval question answering (ReQA). On transfer learning tasks, our multilingual embeddings approach, and in some cases exceed, the performance of English only sentence embeddings.",

    abstract = "Keyphrase extraction is the task of automatically selecting a small set of phrases that best describe a given free text document. Supervised keyphrase extraction requires large amounts of labeled training data and generalizes very poorly outside the domain of the training data. At the same time, unsupervised systems have poor accuracy, and often do not generalize well, as they require the input document to belong to a larger corpus also given as input. Addressing these drawbacks, in this paper, we tackle keyphrase extraction from single documents with EmbedRank: a novel unsupervised method, that leverages sentence embeddings. EmbedRank achieves higher F-scores than graph-based state of the art systems on standard datasets and is suitable for real-time processing of large amounts of Web data. With EmbedRank, we also explicitly increase coverage and diversity among the selected keyphrases by introducing an embedding-based maximal marginal relevance (MMR) for new phrases. A user study including over 200 votes showed that, although reducing the phrases{'} semantic overlap leads to no gains in F-score, our high diversity selection is preferred by humans.",

    abstract = "We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy). Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.",
